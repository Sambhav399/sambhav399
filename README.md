# Hi there 👋 I’m Sambhav Sharma 📍 Noida, India.

Hi, I’m ***Sambhav Sharma***. 
A meticulous frontend developer & designer with over 3+ years of experience. You can also call me a product designer, experience designer, interaction, UI, UX, or any other market-defined function title.

I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 3+ years of experience in a wide range of design disciplines. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself and do interesting things that matter.

Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more than willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me.

I’m a passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied with just coming up with ideas. Instead, I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.

My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study, and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
